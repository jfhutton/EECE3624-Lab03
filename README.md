# Lab03
In this lab you will write an assembly language program that reads simulated sensor data, copies it to a safe location in memory, performs some comparisons using the copied data, and depending on the comparison results, writes certain values to memory. This will give you experience with the various types of assembly language test-and-branch instructions available on the ATmega128A, as well as experience using several advanced features of the Atmel Studio debugger.

Have fun!
