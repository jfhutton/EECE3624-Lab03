 * This program simulates reading sensor data and doing operations on them.
 * It uses memory locations for sensors and result writes.
 * We hope to learn more about branching in assembly.
 *************************************************************************/

/************************************************************************
 * NOTE!  To populate the sensor data to memory, follow these steps!
 * 1) Set breakpoint on 1st instruction RJMP
 * 2) Set the stimulus file
 *    - Debug->Set Stimufile.  Select Lab03.stim
 *    - This only needs to be done ONCE (will save in project file)
 *    - Should be in your Project file from the Repo, but do once to be sure.
 * 3) Execute stimulus file
 *    - Debug->Execute Stimufile
 *    - This needs to be run EVERY TIME you restart a debug session.  :-(
 * 4) single step code
 * 5) Check that data IRAM at 0x0100 has changed "61 97"
 * 
 * Sensor1 Located at 0x0100 (preset to 0x61)
 * Sensor2 Located at 0x0101 (preset to 0x97)
 * 
 * NOTE:  For testing, you can modify these after loading them
 * to make sure all of your branches work properly
